        "description": "It's very easy to think of separation anxiety in a young dog as simply misbehaving, but this is not true. We have to understand that dogs are pack animals, in that they socialise and live their lives in an order that is created by the pack. Dogs are not naturally solitary animals, so being left alone is alien to them and suggests abandonment. It is actually quite amazing that we can get a pack animal like a dog to stay on its own for any length of time at all, without causing undue stress.",
        "body": "<p>Although we often think of dogs and children together, there are certain areas that have to be taken into consideration. A puppy growing up with a child can create a wonderful bond and some memories that the child will take with them into adulthood - but what kind of dog is best to have around with very small children?<p><h4>Choose the right dog</h4><p>Clearly small children are very unpredictable in their behaviour, so you want to avoid a dog that is nervous or easily agitated. You also have to ask yourself can a small child cope with the power of a large dog, even if it’s just being playful? Very loud dogs can also cause stress to a small child.</p><p>If you have very young children you’re likely to be very busy parents so, do you have the time for a dog that needs a lot of exercise, or one that has long hair that needs constant grooming? Also remember that puppies require nearly as much time as young children do, as they have to be trained and constantly reassured.</p><h3>Dogs & Children</h3><h4>Do you really want a dog?</h4><p>This is a question you must ask yourself, because if you are not 100% committed then it is unfair on the animal and the results are likely to be negative anyway. In certain cases, parents have purchased a new puppy simply because the child has wanted one for a long time, and the parents had avoided purchasing one before simply because they knew they lacked the time to care for it. Have the circumstances now changed? Do you have more time on your hands?</p><br/><p>You have to remember that small children are not capable of training a puppy on their own and so the dog will still be totally your responsibility. When a child reaches seven or eight years old they do start to develop a different kind of relationship with pets, where they can take more responsibility and care of the animal themselves. The bond that can now form between child and dog can actually teach both of them some rewarding lessons.</p><h4>Introducing the puppy</h4><p>So you've decided that a new puppy being introduced into the family is a good idea. Before you bring the puppy home, you must get all the essentials in first. You may want the puppy to be a surprise to your family, but it makes a lot of sense to get prepared before you actually bring the dog home. Although you will add to the puppy toys as it grows, it is best to purchase some before it arrives.</p><br/><p>Make sure there are some ground rules in place. The puppy will need time to settle into its new home, as this is a completely new world to it - it's best that it is not constantly played with and left to rest when it needs to. Children should be given times when they are allowed to play with the dog, but do involve them in the care side of the animal straightaway. Deciding where the animal should sleep is another very important decision and it is best that it has its own basket somewhere, rather than sleeping on children’s beds.</p><br/>If you want that bond between the dog and child to be special, then it pays to educate the puppy and the child at the same time. You can do this by showing the child exactly what the dog’s needs are, which will allow them to understand why dogs behave the way they do. You might find that it pays to introduce the puppy into a training class when it is old enough. It would even make sense to purchase or borrow some training books because your dog is going to be with you a long time and investment now will pay off way into the future.</p><br/><h4>A new baby and the family dog</h4><p>Most of the time this is not a real problem if the dog’s feelings are taken into consideration. A dog behaves in almost exactly the same way as a child does when a new baby arrives. They both feel neglected and sometimes jealous, and in both cases this can be put right by showing love and care and giving time in equal proportion. The dog will naturally be very curious when a new baby is introduced, but as long as they still get the attention there should be no problems.</p>"
